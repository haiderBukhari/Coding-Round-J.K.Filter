# Coding Round Sign In and Sign Up MERN Stack Application

Welcome to the Coding Round Sign In and Sign Up MERN Stack Application! This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides user authentication features with a focus on a seamless user experience.

## Backend

The backend of this application is developed using Node.js and Express.js. Here are the key dependencies used:

- **cors**:
- **crypto**
- **dotenv**
- **express**
- **mongoose**
- **morgan**

I have implemented middleware functions for user registration and login to enhance the security and functionality of the application.

## Getting Started

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash

# To Install node_modules folder and install dependencies

npm install

```

Before starting the server, make sure to have a valid MongoDB connection string. Update the .env file with your MongoDB connection details.


```bash

# To start the server, run:

nodemon .\Server\server.js

```
